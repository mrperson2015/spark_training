# Spark Training Project

[[_TOC_]]

## Purpose

This is the top-level directory for PySpark Training. This is to help new hires understand expectations for all PySpark
jobs. This is also intended for current developers to learn the same. This project is a living document and will
continue to be supported and enhanced.

While this project is specifically designed for PySpark jobs, many of these principals should be applied to any ETL job.

## How You Can Help

While every effort has been made to make this project meet all development guidelines and be 100% accurate, I won't
pretend it is perfect. Any questions, comments, or concerns are expected to be raised to the team and/or your manager.

## Topics Covered

### Audits

[Audit Module Details](audit_spark_job/README.md)

Audits run with every job to verify all data is accounted for with no record or data loss. While audits cant guarantee
that the job is bug free. It can show that no data loss has occurred. These can be categorized into two
distinct buckets:

1. _Basic_: steps that can be applied to any job
2. _Specific_: steps that are designed specifically to the current job and its data

### Logging

### Unit Tests

### Self-healing / Restartable

clear out previous failed runs

### Single Execution

## Modules

This training project is designed with a base PySpark job. It is a simple job that meets very little requirements. It
runs and runs without any execution errors. The other modules use this base PySpark job with the specified topic added.

You will want to run and understand the base spark job code well before jumping into the other modules. This will help
you to understand the specific code and purpose of each topic.

Each module is meant to be run standalone in PyCharm. The dependencies for each module is contained within the module
itself and the training_utils project. The source data is randomly generated data. No data connections are needed to run
any module. The output _is_ written to disk but can be deleted after.

### base_spark_job

This module is the base code that the other modules build upon. This is quite a simple project. The requirements to the
job are:

1. Uppercase all values where the field type is string when the record is an update
2. Calculate each row to show the percent of total for field `amount`. Each job execution should total 100%.
